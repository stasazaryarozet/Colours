[INITIALIZATION] Session started.
State: Project initialized.
- Operational model (`OPERATIONAL_MODEL_PROPOSAL.md`) has been adopted.
- Task Statement of Work (`TASK_SOW.md`) has been created.
- Directory structure (`src`, `tests`) and log files (`reasoning.log`, `execution.log`) have been created.

Next step: Proceed with the first development cycle.
- Task: Create a web application for color palette generation based on CIELAB space.
- Plan:
    1. Set up a Node.js project.
    2. Install dependencies for color manipulation (`culori`) and testing (`jest`).
    3. Implement the core color generation logic in `src/`.
    4. Write unit tests for the logic in `tests/`.
    5. Build the web UI.
    6. Publish to GitHub Pages.

[SESSION RESTART]
Current state reconstructed after analyzing project files.
- Project is set up with Node.js, `culori`, and `jest`.
- `TASK_SOW.md` defines a color palette generator web app.
- `tests/colors.test.js` exists and tests a function `generate_shades`.
- The implementation file `src/colors.js` is missing.
- Inconsistency noted: `execution.log` is empty, but project is clearly set up. Assuming logs were cleared.

Next step: Implement the `generate_shades` function in `src/colors.js` to satisfy the existing test case.
- Create `src/colors.js`.
- Write the `generate_shades` function.
- Run tests to validate the implementation.

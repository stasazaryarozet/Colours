[INITIALIZATION] Session started.
State: Project initialized.
- Operational model (`OPERATIONAL_MODEL_PROPOSAL.md`) has been adopted.
- Task Statement of Work (`TASK_SOW.md`) has been created.
- Directory structure (`src`, `tests`) and log files (`reasoning.log`, `execution.log`) have been created.

Next step: Proceed with the first development cycle.
- Task: Create a web application for color palette generation based on CIELAB space.
- Plan:
    1. Set up a Node.js project.
    2. Install dependencies for color manipulation (`culori`) and testing (`jest`).
    3. Implement the core color generation logic in `src/`.
    4. Write unit tests for the logic in `tests/`.
    5. Build the web UI.
    6. Publish to GitHub Pages.
